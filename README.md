# Daily Planner Application
This is the seventh bootcamp challenge. This assignment's goal is to create a functioning daily planner.

## Description

The purpose of this bootcamp challenege was to create a daily planner within the working hours. The assessment criteria were as follows:

-Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

-Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

-Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

-Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

-Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

-Persist events between refreshes of a page.


This challenge was by far the toughest one yet. We were challeneged to use complex javascript and DOM manipulation to construct this page. Due to the time constraints, the code if not as clean as I had hoped for, but it functions well and meets all of the criteria. I really enjoyed doing this task. It really forced me to think about every detail and design of this page.
